Exanite's experimental Discord bot built using Discord.Net.

# Contributing

If you really want to contribute, here is how to do so.

Any Git client can work, but I recommend either using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

2. Create a [Fork](https://github.com/Exanite/DiscordBot/fork) of the project

3. Clone your fork
```
git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/DiscordBot.git
```
4. Use Visual Studio or any other IDE to open the project

5. Create a new branch (`dev/<YourUsername>` or `feature/<YourFeature>`)

6. Make and commit your changes

7. Open a pull request

8. Wait until your pull request is reviewed

Please make sure commit messages, code, and other changes follow this project's existing conventions. (Commits, assets, code, etc)
